# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room client had asked for software to be developed for a game called Draw It or Lose It. This game would be made available across several different  operatign platforms. It would show an image and allow a player to take 30 seconds to guess what the image was. If they guessed wrong then the next player had a chance to guess. The game needed the storage and memory capacity to store and show 200 high definition photos at a high speed rate. They needed a reliable server base that could be accessed from different platforms, including mobile. 
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I believe the overall knowledge base of how an operating system works and the differences between all of them I grasped very well. I learned a lot about windows which is the final operating platform I chose for the development of this program. 
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I really liked the step by step process of diving deeper into the thought process when brainstorming the best approach for the development opf this program. WE looked at storage and memory managemnt and what tools could be used for each operating platforms. We also looked into the Pros and Cons of each operating platform tand the constraints it may pose in our program. This really helped to narrow down the very best options when chosing the operating system for a server based platform. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would take a deeper look into possible constraints. I believe there is many more constraints that I could have noted but wasn't quite aware of those early in the course. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  The user needs are what make a program run seemlessly. If all their needs are met, they should enjoy the program that was created. It is very important to listen to user's needs, and take note on how that need can be implemented and accomplished. It is also improtant to make suggestions from the user's requests to inform them of proper program functionality that could be improved if we make such changes. The user at the end of the day is the one that that has the highest expectationf from a program. If all those expectations are met, then that user will remember you, and come back to you for future projects and updates.  

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I really enjoyed the UML diagrams they really helped me as a visual person, to visualize what it is that the user was requesting. IT also helped me to know what classes were inheriting from one another, and the communication between each of the classes. On the coding side of things, i learned espeically the importance of correct code to ensure that the proper classes were connected and worked off of one another. I believe that i will continue to use UML diagrams to brainstorm the layout and framwork of a program and eventually it's functionality by adding in in classes as needed.
